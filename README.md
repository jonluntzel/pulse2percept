# pulse2percept: A Python-based simulation framework for bionic vision

## Summary

By 2020 roughly 200 million people will suffer from retinal diseases such as
macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. Consequently, a variety of retinal
sight restoration procedures are being developed to target these diseases.
Electronic prostheses (currently being implanted in patients) directly stimulate
remaining retinal cells using electrical current, analogous to a cochlear
implant. Optogenetic prostheses (soon to be implanted in human) use optogenetic
proteins to make remaining retinal cells responsive to light, then use light
diodes (natural illumination is inadequate) implanted in the eye to stimulate
these light sensitive cells.

However, these devices do not restore anything resembling natural vision:
Interactions between the electronics and the underlying neurophysiology result
in significant distortions of the perceptual experience.

We have developed a computer model that has the goal of predicting the perceptual
experience of retinal prosthesis patients.
The model was developed using a variety of patient data describing the brightness
and shape of phosphenes elicited by stimulating single electrodes, and validated
against an independent set of behavioral measures examining spatiotemporal
interactions across multiple electrodes.

The model takes as input a series of (simulated) electrical pulse trains---one pulse
train per electrode in the array---and converts them into an image sequence that
corresponds to the predicted perceptual experience of a patient:

## Installation

### Dependencies

pulse2percept requires:

1.  [Python](http://www.python.org) >= 3.5

2.  [Cython](http://www.cython.org) >= 0.29

3.  [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) >= 1.9

4.  [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org) >= 1.0

5.  [JobLib](https://github.com/joblib/joblib) >= 0.11

**pulse2percept 0.5 was the last version to support Python 2.7.**
pulse2percept 0.6 and later require Python 3.5 or newer.

Optional packages:

    $ python setup.py install
    ```

6.  You can run the test suite to make sure everything works as expected:

    ```bash
    $ make tests
    ```

    Or, on Windows:

    ```bash
    $ pytest --showlocals -v pulse2percept --durations=20
    ```
